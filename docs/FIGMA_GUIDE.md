# Using This Code with Figma

## Can You Copy HTML/CSS into Figma?

**Short answer:** No, Figma doesn't directly import HTML/CSS code. However, there are several ways to work with both:

## Option 1: Design First in Figma, Then Code
1. **Design your website in Figma** with all layouts, colors, fonts, and spacing
2. **Export assets** (images, icons) from Figma
3. **Use the design as reference** while coding
4. **Match the design** using the HTML/CSS code

## Option 2: Code First, Then Recreate in Figma
1. **Use this HTML/CSS code** as reference
2. **Recreate the design in Figma** manually
3. **Use Figma's layout tools** (Auto Layout, Grid, Constraints) to match the structure
4. **Export for presentations** or client approvals

## Option 3: Use Figma Plugins
There are plugins that can help:
- **HTML to Figma** - Converts HTML to Figma frames (limited)
- **Figma to Code** - Exports Figma designs to code (reverse direction)
- **Figma Dev Mode** - Shows CSS properties for developers

## Option 4: Use the Code Structure in Figma

### Grid System in Figma:
- Create a **Grid Layout** in Figma matching the CSS Grid structure
- Use **Auto Layout** for Flexbox-like behavior
- Set up **Frames** with the same dimensions as your containers

### Example Mapping:
- **CSS Grid** → Figma Grid Layout
- **Flexbox** → Figma Auto Layout
- **Container (1200px)** → Frame with max-width constraint
- **Gap (60px)** → Auto Layout spacing

## Best Workflow:

1. **For Design Iterations:**
   - Design in Figma
   - Export assets
   - Code using this structure

2. **For Code Adjustments:**
   - Modify this HTML/CSS code
   - Update Figma design to match
   - Keep both in sync

## Tips:
- Use **CSS Grid** structure → Create Grid Layouts in Figma
- Use **Flexbox** structure → Use Auto Layout in Figma
- Match **spacing** (gaps, padding) between both
- Use **same color values** (#0066cc, etc.)
- Match **font sizes** and weights

The code is already well-structured with Grid and Flexbox, making it easy to recreate in Figma!
