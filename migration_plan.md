# Migration & Cleanup Plan

## Current Status
- ✅ Core files migrated from `Dec 2025` to root.
- ✅ Old files removed.
- ✅ Initial commit pushed.
- ⚠️ Image renaming process was interrupted/hung.
- ⚠️ Git state needs verification.

## Remaining Tasks
1. **Verify Image State**: Check if images in `images/` subfolders have been renamed to their optimized filenames (e.g., `dr-sahu-hero.webp`).
2. **Complete Renaming**: If renaming failed or was partial, re-run the rename commands.
3. **Verify Git Status**: Check for unstaged changes (the favicon fix and any image moves).
4. **Final Commit & Push**: Commit the image renames and index.html fixes.
5. **Clean Up**: Remove any temporary backup folders if confirmed safe.

## User Action Required
- Review this plan and approve the next steps.
